VM bootstrap playbooks
======================

These are the Ansible__ playbooks I use to bootstrap new FreeBSD VMs.

Usage
=====

Spin up a minimal install of FreeBSD, creating just a root user. Give the host
a unique name. I call mine gary__, as I like to use Spongebob Squarepants
characters as VM names.

As start the VM as root and run the following::

    sed -E -i '' 's/^#(PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication).*/\1 yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    service sshd restart

This allows us to bootstrap the instance as root.

Take note of the VM's IP address with ``ipconfig``, and update the `hosts`
file to something like this::

   gary.local ansible_host=192.168.0.100

   [bootstrap]
   gary.local

   [bootstrap:vars]
   ansible_connection=paramiko

   [freebsd]
   gary.local

   [freebsd:vars]
   ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python3

Here, I'm using `gary.local`, the mDNS__ name, as the VM will be advertised in
the mDNS `.local` domain once mDNS is configured on it.

Replace `192.168.0.100` with whatever your VM's IP address is.

To initially bootstrap everything, run::

   make bootstrap

This will install OpenMDNS__, which will make your VM advertise itself by name
over multicast DNS. You can now update the `hosts` file to remove the
`ansible_host` variable.

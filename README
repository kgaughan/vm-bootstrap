VM bootstrap playbooks
======================

These are the Ansible__ playbooks I use to bootstrap new FreeBSD VMs for local
use.

Usage
=====

Spin up a minimal install of FreeBSD, creating just a root user. Give the host
a unique name. I call mine gary__, as I like to use Spongebob Squarepants
characters as VM names.

Out of the box, we can't SSH into the instance as root, so start the VM as
root and run the following::

    sed -E -i '' 's/^#(PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication).*/\1 yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    service sshd restart

This allows us to bootstrap the instance as root.

Take note of the VM's IP address with ``ipconfig`` and run (replacing ``<ip>``
with the VM's IP address)::

   ansible-playbook -i <ip>, --extra-vars @config.yml bootstrap.yml --ask-pass

This will also install OpenMDNS__, which will make your VM advertise itself by
name over `multicast DNS`__, and lock down root access to the VM again.
